- Linux binaries are 32 bit application statically linked with MySQL libraries version 5.5.53
  If you experience problems running Lemlat on a 64-bit version of Ubuntu (more recent than version 12), you have to install 
  a 32-bit compatible version of some libraries. Running the following commands from the shell should solve the issue:
      sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install libaio1:i386 libpulse0:i386 zlib1g:i386 libc6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386
  
- Windows binaries are 32 bit application statically linked with MySQL libraries version 5.5.54

- OSX binaries are 64 bit application statically linked with MySQL libraries version 5.6.20
